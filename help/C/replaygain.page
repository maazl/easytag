  <title><gui>ReplayGain</gui> information</title>

  <p><link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReplayGain">ReplayGain</link>
  is a psychoacoustic model to equalize the loudness of different tracks
  during playback.</p>

  <p>EasyTAG supports the calculation of ReplayGain information for all
  supported file formats. You may also edit the replay gain values manually.
  However, this is not recommended.</p>

<section id="grouping">
  <title>Grouping for album gain</title>

  <p>To avoid changes of the relative loudness while playing a complete album
  ReplayGain supports track level and album level values.
  For calculation of latter all files that belong to the same album
  are analyzed as one large block. <em>It is essential to select all files
  of an album at once in order to get this working.</em></p>

  <p>EasyTAG uses the album title tag by default to group the files to analyze
  into albums. But you may chose another grouping mode in the preferences dialog.</p>

  <terms>
    <item>
      <title><gui>Group by album</gui></title>
      <p>Only files with the same album title tag are analyzed together.
      If an album consists of multiple media all media will be analyzed together
      and get the same album gain value. This is the default.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title><gui>Group by album and disc</gui></title>
      <p>The album title and the disc number is used to identify tracks
      that belong to the same album. If the tracks have no disc number tag
      the behavior is the same than <gui>Group by album</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title><gui>Group by file path</gui></title>
      <p>Files that are in the same directory are analyzed together
      for the album gain. No tags are used during analysis.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title><gui>No grouping</gui></title>
      <p>All selected files are considered to belong to the same album.
      Use this mode if you want to do the grouping of the files manually.</p>

  <title><gui>ReplayGain version</gui></title>

  <p>EasyTAG supports different versions of ReplayGain:</p>

  <terms>
    <item>
      <title><link href="https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=ReplayGain_1.0_specification">ReplayGain version 1.0</link></title>
      <p>This is the original standard by David Robinson in 2001.
      It models the equal-loudness contour of the human ear quite accurately.
      The drawback is the caclulation time required for analysis. Furthermore
      there is no specification how to handle multi channel audio.
      EasyTAG enhaces the standard slightly to support multiple channels.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title><link href="https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=ReplayGain_2.0_specification">ReplayGain version 2.0</link></title>
      <p>This version, also known as international standard ITU-R BS.1770.3
      or EBU-128, is a simplified model that is much faster to calculate.
      It is used e.g. by broadcasting services.
      The newer standard also covers multi channel audio.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title><gui>Hybrid</gui> of version 1 and 2</title>
      <p>EasyTAG also supports a 3rd, even more sophisticated model.
      It combines the best of two worlds, i.e. the larger and overlapping
      time blocks and the multi channel handling of ReplayGain 2.0 with the
      more accurate equal-loudness contour of ReplayGain 1.0. The latter
      is significantly less sensitive to inaudible high frequency noise in
      some recordings. Calculation time is similar to version 1.0.</p>
    </item>
  </terms>

  <p>Since the ReplayGain calculation is always an approximation
  the result is sensitive to rounding differences. So when comaring
  to the results of other applications like mp3gain you may observe
  differences in the order of 0.1&#xa0;dB. Given that 1&#xa0;dB is roughly
  the smallest audible loudness deifference you can saflely ignore them.</p>

  <title>Restrictions</title>

  <list>
    <item>
      <p>EasyTAG cannot modify the gain fields in the sideinfo blocks
      of MPEG audio files like tools like mp3gain can do. It is a tag editor
      not a bit stream processor. Only the ReplayGain tags are updated to let
      the player software adjust the loudness.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p><em>MP4 files require Taglib library version 2.0 or above.</em>
      Older versions cannot access the ReplayGain tags.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      ReplayGain tags in MP4 files are stored in iTunes format only
      rather than an embedded ID3V2 tag as recommended by the ReplayGain
      specification at hydrogenaudio. This is supported most widely.
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>EasyTag currently support <em>no asyncronuous operation</em>,
      i.e. the UI gets blocked during time-consuming operations.
      This causes the application to be quite unresponsive during
      calculation of ReplayGain.</p>
